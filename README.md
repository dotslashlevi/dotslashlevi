- I’m currently working on a website for my Minecraft texturepacks, info, and portfolio.
- I’m currently learning html+css, and C#. I keep forgetting C# exists ngl.
- Pronouns: He/Him.
- Fun Fact: I suck at coding in c++ and C# so don't even ask for a project such as an autoclicker or reach hack, as I need to get the basics down.
